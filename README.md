We made some modifications for the answers, such as:

1. Using regex to make correct format when entering email.
2. If we choose NO for question regarding software development question, it will ask immediately about Javascript library instead of asking how many years of working experience.
3. Making some options where invalid answers will return error message when entering invalid number of desired salary, salary under and above 10.000.000.
